# **Overview**

This tutorial will guide you through working examples that will allow You to **experiment with different options to provide persistence storage to containers in different scenarios** as per this blogpost (LINK TBD).

We will details the steps for these use cases
1. Single Container running with **persistent storage**
2. Single Container with persistent storage running across **multiple Container Hosts**
3. Single Container with persistent storage running across multiple Container Hosts and **multiple Availability Zones**
4. Single container with single persistent **datastore that spans across Availability Zones**

Each setup will provide prerequisites, instructions and clean up procedures.

**All code is provided** <u>**AS IS**</u>**: it is not meant for production workloads but for test environments only.**

You may incur in costs for testing these setups so we recommend to take this into account and tear down the environments after performing your tests.

You can find a tutorial for each use case in the folders available in this repository.
